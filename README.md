# Movie-List-Activity
This is my refactoring version that I changed the white background to the black background to make those cards standout.Â 
The orginal code is part of activity 17: Converting Web Components To React Components.
I also tried to add a search bar in case we have more movie cards in the list, so it will help users find a movie faster related to the movie's name. But it is going to be my future development.
